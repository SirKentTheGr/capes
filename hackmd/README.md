# HackMD
This project is created and maintained by the HackMD team. All credit for the service goes to their talented team.

_Knowledge are generated throughout the entire life cycle of your project. From problem discovery to product delivery, your project is forged through many insightful chats and many decisions made. Too often you find your notes all over the place yet you cannot locate the specific detail you need. The project is an entirety, so should your documentation be. HackMD is the only tool you need for technical documentation._

We use HackMD to collaboratively work on incident report and note taking.

## Documentation / Installation
