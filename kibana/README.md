# Elastic Kibana
This project is created and maintained by the Elastic Kibana team. All credit for the service goes to their talented team.

_Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so you can do anything from learning why you're getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on your quarterly numbers._

We use Kibana to visualize data from the CAPES stack regarding the service and system health; although it can be used to visualize any Elasticsearch data, such as the data from [ROCKNSM](http://rocknsm.io).

## Documentation / Installation
