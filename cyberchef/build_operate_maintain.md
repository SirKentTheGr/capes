# CyberChef Build, Operate, Maintain
There should probably be more here but...those GCHQ guys got their stuff together.

Of particular note, all images in the `.htm` file are base64 encoded, so there is no need for any Internet access for a good UX.

## Build
```
$ curl -O https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/cyberchef.htm
```

## Operate
Open `cyberchef.htm` in a web browser.

## Maintain
If you need any updates, just re-run the download above to get an updated version of CyberChef.
